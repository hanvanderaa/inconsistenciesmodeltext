 happen to know somebody, who is interested in the product.";;;;;;Then we start calling the customer.;;;;;;"That is done by the call center
  staff.";;;;;;They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project.;;;;;;"Of course, asking the
   customer whether he is generally interested is also important.";;;;;;"If this is not the case, we leave him alone, except if the
    potential project budget is huge.";;;;;;Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer.;;;;;;"If the customer is 
    interested in the end, the next step is a detailed online presentation.";;;;;;"It is given either by a sales representative or by
     a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation.";;;;;;Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us.;;;;;;If we are not contacted within 2 weeks, a sales representative is calling the customer.;;;;;;"The last phase is the creation of a
