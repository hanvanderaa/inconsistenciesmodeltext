registration, the telephone is sent to the Problem Detection (PD) depart-
ment.";;;;;;There it is analyzed and its defect is categorized.;;;;;;"In total, there are
10 different categories of defects that the phones fixed by this company can
have.";;;;;;"Once the problem is identified, the telephone is sent to the Repair
department and a letter is sent to the customer to inform him/her about the
problem.";;;;;;The Repair (R) department has two teams.;;;;;;"One of the teams can
fix simple defects and the other team can repair complex defects.";;;;;;"However,
some of the defect categories can be repaired by both teams.";;;;;;"Once a repair
employee finishes working on a phone, this device is sent to the Quality Assurance (QA) department.";;;;;;"There it is analyzed by an employee to check if
the defect was indeed fixed or not.";;;;;;"If the defect is not repaired, the telephone
is again sent to the Repair department.";;;;;;"If the telephone is indeed repaired,
the case is archived and the telephone is sent to the customer.";;;;;;"To save on
throughput time, the company only tries to fix a defect a limited number of
times.";;;;;;"If the defect is not fixed, the case is archived anyway and a brand
new device is sent to the customer.";;;;;;
